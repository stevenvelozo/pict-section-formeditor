# Keyboard Shortcuts

The form editor supports keyboard shortcuts for common editing tasks. These work in the visual editor and properties panel.

## Inline Editing

When editing a name, hash, or layout value inline in the visual editor:

- **Enter** -- Confirm the edit and save the value
- **Escape** -- Cancel the edit and revert to the original value

## Input Type Picker

When the input type picker is open:

- **Escape** -- Close the picker without making a selection
- Type in the search box to filter input types by name

## Searchable Selectors

The Group tab and other searchable dropdowns support keyboard navigation:

- **Escape** -- Close the dropdown
- Type to filter the list of items

## Solver Editor

When working in the solver code editor:

- The code editor supports standard text editing shortcuts (select all, copy, paste, undo, redo)
- Click **Insert** next to any input in the reference list to paste its address at the cursor

## General Tips

- Click any editable label in the visual editor to begin inline editing
- Click a section, group, or input to select it and show its properties
- Use the properties panel tabs to switch between Form, Section, Group, Input, Options, and Help views
- The tab bar shows a menu button when there are more tabs than can fit; click it to see hidden tabs
